# Boston COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution - April 2021

This is my groups' final project from **INSH 2102 - Bostonography: The City through Data, Texts, Maps, and Networks**. For our project, we were tasked with using Boston as a case study for integrating computational methods with the social sciences and humanities to provide new insights into major cultural, historical, and societal questions as they relate to and extend beyond the city of Boston. At the beginning of COVID-19 vaccine rollout in Massachusetts, my group was interested in learning more about how Massachusetts would handle equitable distribution and access after we read an article in the Boston Globe detailing stark disparities in Black and Latinx communities in gaining access to the vaccine. Throughout this project, we used Python's pandas library to get a good analysis of how Boston and the surrounding areas have handled the vaccine rollout by looking at whether or not the hardest hit communities, specifically those of lower socioeconomic status, will have equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines.

## Components of our Project

BostonVaccineDistribution.ipynb
* This is our final Jupyter Notebook submission. It summarizes all of the findings in our Digital Poster Presentation and presents all of our data in an easy to follow notebook format

CSVs
* These are the data sets we created and used. These are required to run our Jupyter Notebook, so you may need to move the Jupyter Notebook into this folder in order to run it. These include:
	* Massachusetts_Vaccine_Sites.csv
	* County_Covid_CSV.csv
	* County_Wealth_CSV.csv
	* County_Demo_CSV.csv

Works Cited
* Our bibliography cited in APA format
